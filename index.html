    <section>
      <p> This first part is the inspiration for YOU doing the project. Spending 2 weeks on a project requires you to be really inspired by the topic. It is something you are willing to spend the time, beyond your day-to-day work. And hopefully, work on iterating on the output, even beyond the project time. It is a topic that you have been talking / thinking / planning about doing for a long-time and now is the right time to do it.
